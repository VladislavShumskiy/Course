### Case being solved
It's required to write a program capable of guessing a random number in the minimal number of tries.

**Conditions:**
- Computer creates a random number from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it.
- An algorythm takes into account if our guess is higher or lower than the correct answer.

**Result metrics:**
The result is judjed by the number of tries it takes our program to reach the correct result on average given 1000 attempts.
