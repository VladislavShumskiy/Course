### Project description
The task is to guess the random number from 1 to 100 as fast as possible.

### Case being solved
It's required to write a program capable of guessing a random number in the minimal number of tries.

**Conditions:**
- Computer creates a random number from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it.
- When an algorythm makes a guess it recieves information about answer being higher or lower than it.

**Result metrics:**
The result is judjed by the number of tries it takes our program to reach the correct result on average given 1000 attempts.

### Steps in the work on the project
Three algorythms are being compared:
-The first one takes random guesses untill it stumbles upon a correct answer.
-The second one rakes random guesses while taking into account whether the last guess was higher or lower than the correct answer.
-The third one does a binary search for a correct answer.
